This Apps Allow Stores to integrate with the **Recommendation Shelves** that **ClerkIO Provides.**

## Main Features

1. The app has the option of creating a feed per **language and per binding** supported on the store.
2. Design of the shelf and the recommendation comes from ClerkIO.
3. The Store can Declare the ClerkIO Block **anywhere** on their site and configure the **Recommendation Logic** as they need on **VTEX Site-Editor**.

## Initial Setup

1. On the **vtex cli** run `vtex install vtex.clerkio-integration`.
   You can confirm that the app has now been installed by running `vtex ls` again.
2. Access the **Apps** section in your account's admin page and look for the **ClerkIO Integration** box. Once you find it, click on the box.
   Fill in the Fields as requested. For MultiBinding Sites, click on the enable configuration by binding to match a Clerk Store to each Binding.
3. Generate the feeds for products, categories and orders by making a POST request to the following endpoints (replacing the account and workspace):

- Products feed:

```
https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.clerkio-integration/v1/{{account}}/{{workspace}}/_v/clerkio-integration/feed/products
```

- Categories feed:

```
https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.clerkio-integration/v1/{{account}}/{{workspace}}/_v/clerkio-integration/feed/categories
```

- Orders feed\*:

```
https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.clerkio-integration/v1/{{account}}/{{workspace}}/_v/clerkio-integration/feed/orders
```

_**Notes:**_

_**Depending on the size of your store Catalogue the feed might take some time to generate**_

_\* **There is a [known issue](#known-issues) with the generation of the orders feed**_

## Configuration VTEX

_**Important: Before proceeding please make sure you have already completed the setup in ClerkIO following the instructions [below](#configuration-clerkio)**_

1. On your store theme, Add `vtex.clerkio-integration` 1.x as a theme peerDependency in the `manifest.json` file

   ```json
   "peerDependencies": {
   "vtex.clerkio-integration": "1.x"
   }
   ```

2. add the `clerkio`block anywhere on your store. Example: in `home.json`

```json
{
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": [
      "responsive-layout.desktop#homepage",
      "responsive-layout.mobile#homepage"
    ]
  },
  "responsive-layout.desktop#homepage": {
    "children": ["clerkio"]
  }
}
```

_**Note: for this step onwards, please make sure you have already completed the configuration on ClerkIO steps 1 - 4.**_

3. Go to VTEX Site Editor, and on the right side menu a ClerkIO block will be displayed. Click on it.

4. Fill in the information required on the block.
   `Block Class Name`: any name different from clerk.
   `Template Name`: insert the ID provided by Clerk on the previously created Content.
   `Product Logic`: match the recommendation logic to the one specified on the previously created Content on Clerk. User can get the details and usage for different product logics on Clerk.io. The available product logics are:

| Product Logic                     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Configuration ClerkIO

1. Create a new store on ClerkIO dashboard. For multi-binding sites, each binding should be a store on Clerk.
2. Go to Data -> Data Sync Settings -> Sync Method and Select `ClerkIO JSON Feed`. once prompted to insert the url, insert the following URL format:
   `https://{{accountName}}.myvtex.com/_v/clerkio-integration/clerk-feed/{{bindingId}}`
   and click on data sync. _**This feed URL is exclusive for the use of ClerkIO.**_

If you want to validate your store's feed use this endpoint instead:
`https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.clerkio-integration/v1/{{accountName}}/{{workspace}}/_v/clerkio-integration/clerk-feed/{{bindingId}}`
this endpoint requires VTEX authentication.

3. Go to Recommendations -> Design and create a new Shelf design to suit your store Style.
4. Go to Recommendations -> Content and create a new recommendation using the previously defined Design and the business rule you want to apply.
   Repeat this step for every recommendation rule you want to include on your store.

## Known Issues

#### Order feed generation

There is an issue with the generation of the order feed when a store has a high volume of orders. There is not a specific number of orders that could cause this issue, but we tested the generation of the feed in accounts with less than 30k orders without issues although this is not a guaranteed result.
A possible workaround for this would be to install the app in a production workspace for the account while the integration is in the process of being implemented (this has been done in some accounts where the implementation procees lasted three months). This way and by configuring on Clerk's admin panel for the store, the orders receveid by the store while in development could be used by Clerk to get the data they need.
